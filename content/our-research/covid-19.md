<p>UKHSA has conducted over 150 research and surveillance studies, most in collaboration with academics, to better understand SARS CoV-2 virus and its transmission.</p>
<p>We have published or submitted over 200 new research papers, commentaries and editorials on all aspects of the SARS CoV-2 virus, the illness it causes and how to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Below is one of many studies contributing to the scientific knowledge base for the virus.</p>

<p>SIREN (Sarscov2 Immunity & REinfection EvaluatioN): The impact of detectable anti SARS-COV2 antibody on the incidence of COVID-19 in healthcare workers</p>
<h4 class="h5">What is the SIREN study?</h4>
<p>The purpose of this study is to understand whether prior infection with SARS-CoV2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) protects against future infection with the same virus.</p>
<p>The study has received approval from the NHS Health Research Authority Berkshire Research Ethics Committee and is funded by the National Institute of Health Research and Public Health England.</p>
