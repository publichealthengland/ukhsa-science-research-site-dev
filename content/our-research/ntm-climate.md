description: "Non tuberculous mycobacteria are environmental pathogens that cause infections with a high health burden. They are in the same bacteria family that cause tuberculosis, but are themselves not a cause of tuberculosis.  Non-tuberculous are resistant to conventional water treatment methods, such as chlorine, and a range of antibiotics. Researchers from the Global Assessment and Emerging Hazards team at UKHSA explored international meteorological and incidence data to identify environmental conditions driving increasing infections internationally. They used machine learning models to forecast how Non-tuberculous mycobacteria infections might increase in the UK in the next 10 years, based on climate change projections."

<p>Non-tuberculous mycobacteria  are, environmental pathogens that cause infections with a high health burden. They are in the same bacteria family that cause tuberculosis, but are themselves not a cause of tuberculosis.  Non-tuberculous are resistant to conventional water treatment methods, such as chlorine, and a range of antibiotics. Researchers from the Global Assessment and Emerging Hazards team at UKHSA explored international meteorological and incidence data to identify environmental conditions driving increasing infections internationally. They used machine learning models to forecast how Non-tuberculous mycobacteria infections might increase in the UK in the next 10 years, based on climate change projections.</p>

<p>Non-tuberculous mycobacteria cause lung and skin infections with high mortality rates and antibiotic resistance.  Infections are acquired from environmental exposures, as non-tuberculous mycobacteria reside in water sources and soil. They are found in fresh and brackish waters, as they have a low saline tolerance. Increased levels of non-tuberculous mycobacteria in treated municipal water supplies have been observed during warmer months in Europe and South America. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria incidences are known to be increasing in countries where they are notifiable but the situation in the UK is difficult to assess as non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections are not a notifiable disease.</p>
