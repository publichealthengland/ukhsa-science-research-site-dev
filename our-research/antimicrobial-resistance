<p>In England, there are around 2 million people currently living in homes with <a style="color:white;" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-housing-survey-2021-to-2022-headline-report">significant damp and/or mould (3-4% of residences)</a>. While living in a damp and/or mouldy home is associated with the development or exacerbation of several respiratory diseases, conditions and symptoms, little is known about the burden of disease at a national scale in England.</p>

<p>Research led by scientists from the Air Quality and Public Health team, Environmental Hazards and Emergency Department and the Toxicology Department assessed the <a style="color:white;" href="https://researchportal.ukhsa.gov.uk/en/publications/the-burden-of-respiratory-disease-from-formaldehyde-damp-and-moul">burden of asthma, lower respiratory infections, and allergic rhinitis from exposure to damp and/or mould in England in 2019</a> and by looking back several years in time. For this purpose, epidemiological evidence was combined with health and exposure data from nation-wide <a style="color:white;" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/english-housing-survey">annual surveys</a> and <a style="color:white;" href="https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/">modelled estimates</a>. They found that there was a considerable burden of respiratory illness/conditions in England from residential exposures to damp and mould (2,800) <a style="color:white;" href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/158#:~:text=Definition%3A-,One%20DALY%20represents%20the%20loss%20of%20the%20equivalent%20of%20one,health%20condition%20in%20a%20population">Disability Adjusted Life Years lost</a> in 2019, which was lower than 10 years prior, but may still be an under-estimate. They also found that ethnic and minority and disadvantaged groups were disproportionately impacted by damp and mould reflecting a persistent environmental health inequity.</p>

<p>The team contributed to the development of <a style="color:white;" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/damp-and-mould-understanding-and-addressing-the-health-risks-for-rented-housing-providers/understanding-and-addressing-the-health-risks-of-damp-and-mould-in-the-home--2">new consolidated guidance on damp and mould</a>, which was a joint effort by the Department for Health and Social Care, UK Health Security Agency, and Department for Levelling up, Housing and Communities, following the inquest into the tragic death of 2-year-old Awaab Ishak from prolonged exposure to mould. The burden of disease evidence fed into this guidance.</p>
